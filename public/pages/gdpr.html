        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
      <p class="class=" max-w-2xl mb-6 font-light text-gray-500 lg:mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        According to the Article 23 of the GDPR, Privacy by Design is now a legal requirement. Privacy by design is a
        development concept that makes an app developer, owner or publisher think of user privacy before starting the
        development process. Instead of leaving user privacy and data protection as an afterthought, your app
        development
        efforts should take steps to promote user privacy from the beginning, itself.

      <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white"></h2>Ask for user consent
      explicitly</h2>
      Every app or company must request a user to provide his/her consent to collect, use and transfer personal data. A
      user,
      while opting-in, must clearly understand the terms and conditions of personal data collection and usage.

      If you are thinking of collecting user data in your mobile app, you must have an opt-in screen as soon as an app
      launches. The opt-in process should clearly give user the ability to provide consent to data collection, receive
      communication and should inform users about the places where data will be used.

      For example, if you are thinking of tracking user activity through Google Analytics, you are obligated to inform
      them
      about the same. At the same time, a user must be able to easily opt-out from future communications and request
      deletion
      of personal information. An app should have a dedicated page to give users the ability to opt-out to be completely
      GDPR-compliant.

      <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Promote transparency through
        an understandable privacy policy</h2>
      To comply with GDPR completely, you need to inform users about your privacy policy. The policy should be
      documented in
      clear language without jargons so that a common user can understand the same. It should inform users about how you
      plan
      to manage and protect their personal data. Also, you will be required to disclose your source of data collection
      and
      processing if you are using a third-party solution.

      </p>
      <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">keep a record of data
        processing activities.</h2>
      <p class="class=" max-w-2xl mb-6 font-light text-gray-500 lg:mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        Respond to user requests
        Under GDPR, you are legally required to answer a user if he/she wants to know how you are using their personal
        data. To
        make your app compliant, you need to create a mechanism using which user can place a Subject Access Request.
        Once you
        receive such a request from any user, you are required to respond to it within one month. (For complicated
        requests, the
        period is three months)

        Developing an internal system to subject access requests is essential to stay compliant in the long term,
        failing which
        you would be breaking the privacy law, landing yourself in a legal trouble.

        Review your third-party data processors

        If you are using the services of any external data processor to analyze your app usage, you must disclose the
        fact
        explicitly. You need to be transparent with the users about data transfer and processing and at the same time
        sign a
        detailed data processing agreement.

        Having a documented agreement with your data processor is a mandatory requirement to comply with GDPR. This
        means that
        you need to make sure that all third party and SDKs associated with your app are also required to be compliant
        with
        GDPR. As a data controller, it is your responsibility to ensure that all third parties are compliant and have
        efficient
        data security measures in place. In case of a security breach, you can be held accountable.

        Notify users of a data breach
        As a data controller, you are required to notify all the users and supervisory authorities of data breach if one
        occurs
        within 72 hours under the GDPR. In order to make this a reality, you might need to continuously monitor your
        data,
        identify risks and plug in loopholes. In case of a breach, you must have a clear policy to inform users and take
        necessary steps to protect their personal data.

        Encrypt your stored data and external communications
        Every mobile app should essentially use SSL or HTTPS protocol for interaction with external players. Also,
        personal data
        sharing should always be encrypted. This means that when your mobile app interacts with your website or web
        servers to
        transfer personal data such as username or password, an SSL or HTTPS protocol must be in place.

        To make sure that user data is secure at all times, the data should be stored securely at a safe place with
        appropriate
        encrypted backups. Users should be notified about the tenure of this storage explicitly to give them control
        over their
        personal information.
