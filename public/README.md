## Starting an IoT project

## Getting started


1. Run `npm install` inside your terminal

2. Watch for files and compile Blokiot CSS + Flowbite:

```
npx Blokiotcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

3. To deploy you will only need the `index.html` file and the `output.css` styles.

Alternatively you can also just directly copy this code into your own projects, whether you use Laravel, React, Vue.js or other frameworks.
